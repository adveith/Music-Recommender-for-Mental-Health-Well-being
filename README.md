# Music Recommender for Mental Health Well-being
 MoodCare is an open-source, zero-cost music recommendation system designed to support users dealing with stress, depression, and anxiety by recommending songs based on both lyrics and audio features.  This project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and audio signal analysis to understand emotional tones in song lyrics and musical properties like tempo, valence, and energy. It provides personalized recommendations that align with the user's emotional state — and explains why each song is suggested.  🔬 Key Features 🎵 Multimodal Recommendation Engine Combines Spotify audio features (via spotipy) and emotion analysis of lyrics for holistic mood-based recommendations.  🧠 Mental Health Focused Curated to address stress, depression, and anxiety using psychological cues from both lyrics and acoustic signals.  🧾 Lyrics Emotion Detection Uses lexicon-based or transformer-based models (like NRC Lexicon or cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion) for emotion scoring.  🎛️ Hybrid Scoring Algorithm Fuses emotional tones and audio features into a single explainable recommendation score.  📊 Explainability & Visualizations Shows why each song was selected using mood mapping, pie charts, and radar graphs.  🧪 Fully Offline & Free No paid APIs, no subscriptions — 100% open-source using free datasets and models.  🌐 Streamlit UI Simple web interface for users to input their mood, view song suggestions, and visualize mood analytics.  🚀 Tech Stack Python · Streamlit · Spotipy · LyricsGenius  Transformers / NRC Lexicon · Pandas · Matplotlib / Plotly  Google Colab / VS Code
