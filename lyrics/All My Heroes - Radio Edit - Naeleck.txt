1 ContributorAll My Heroes (Radio Edit) Lyrics
Whatever mess you're in
The demons you've been fightin'
Know that your quest is only just beginning
Everything you've been through
Has led you to this moment, focus
Be present, let your spirit guide you
Now that you're on your way
Wherever you walk you radiate
And you create the destiny that you've been dreaming of
This mess you're in
This mess you're in
This mess you're in

A voice called out to you
Strange how you can't turn away
You've got someone who's true
Whеn the darkness becomеs too great
A voice called out to you
Strange how you can’t turn away
You’ve got someone who’s true
When the darkness becomes too great

Please, I don’t need you to explain
Just look within, don’t be afraid
I’ve been there too and made mistakes
But I know you're stronger than you think

Now that you're on your way
Wherever you walk you radiate
And you create the destiny that you've been dreaming of
Everything you've been through
Has led you to this moment, focus
Be present, let your spirit guide you

Whatever mess you’re in
Whatever mess you’re in
The demons you’ve been fighting
Whatever mess you’re in
Whatever mess you’re in
The demons you’ve been fighting

Just look within, don't be afraid
Just look within, don't be afraid

All my heroes, let me hear you
All my heroes, let me hear you
