I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell bring me back again
Play me the classics, somethin' romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, barely believin'
Startin' to think that I've lost all feelin'

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringin' me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't gеt any better
Started givin' up on thе word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

I'll fall in love with the little things
Countin' the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret and, baby, I'll keep it
And maybe we can play house for the weekend

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringin' me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't get any better
Started givin' up on the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waitin' for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't get any better
Started givin' up on the word "forever" (Ooh, forever)
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
