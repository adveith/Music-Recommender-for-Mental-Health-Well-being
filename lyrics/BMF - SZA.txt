Young and fine and dark and handsome
The boy from South Detroit keep bossing
And I can't keep my panties from dropping
He's so fly, fly

Going too fast, don't hurt yourself
I can't keep up with all the lies you tell yourself
You kinda cute, but play too much, don't play yourself
I'm not the one, but we can still pretend this can be my man
You say you feel different when you with me, tell me anything
Compliment my energy, it's different laying next to me
All I ask is don't make me pull up and get to dumping
You know I can't give no fucks, you know I'm with all the ruckus, can you?

Young and fine and dark and handsome
The boy West side of Compton camе walking in
I can't keep my panties from dropping
He's so fly, fly

Ooh, he bossy, ooh, hе crip walkin'
Took me to Slauson and he slut me out
And when I got a problem, he get to packing
He 'bout all that action, call him Mr. Handle It
You know I'm hella different from them chickens you been trickin' on
I can be your ride or die, get down your strongest bone
Trust me, boy, I'm good in every hood
Trickin', finna fall in backwards
I'm just tryna show you what it would be like if you my man

Young and fine and dark and handsome
The boy from South of somewhere came walking in
And I can't keep my panties from dropping
He's so fly, fly

Blowin' money fast, it won't last (Oh-woah)
Tryna make it last, ooh-oh
Blowin' money fast, we might crash (Mmm)
I'll make it last, we'll be— oh-oh

Ecstasy is just a pill away
Pop it up or you could screw today
I'm just tryna hear you say my name
Love to play your ruler, be your Jane
You could be my Tarzan, toss me up
Other hoes is lacking, call me up
Know my baby packing, why I'm stuck
That's why he my man

Young and he fine and he tall and he handsome
Talkin' so fine, I might hold it for ransom
Put it in drive, I'm not shy, I might let ya
Cruise all night

Blowin' money fast, it won't last (Oh-woah)
Tryna make it last, ooh-oh
Blowin' money fast, we might crash (Mmm)
I'll make it last, we'll be— oh-oh
