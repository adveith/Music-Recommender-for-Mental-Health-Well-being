Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hangin' about
I'm just a-lookin' at the sky 'cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and runnin' wild

'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Oh, back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang, ooh, with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just a-makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get outta my way

'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black


Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow

Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yes, I am
Oh, yeah
Yeah
Ah, hey, yeah
Here we go

Well, I'm back (I'm back)
Back, well, I'm (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back
It's back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Outta the sack
