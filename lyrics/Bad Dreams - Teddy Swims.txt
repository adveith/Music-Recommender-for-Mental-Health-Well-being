Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light, steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth (Ooh)

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep

Slipping into bad dreams (Bad dreams)
Where there's no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these
Bad dreams (Bad dreams)
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these, all of these

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bad dreams
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All of these

Baby, please come around, help me settle down
Hellish habits can cloud my head (Mm)
What you waiting for? Something physical?
I can't do this by myself

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I'd do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you, I keep

Slipping into bad dreams
Where there's no you and I (You and I)
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free (Set me free)
From all of these (All of these)
Bad dreams
Waitin' on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free (Set me free)
From all of these, all of these

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bad dreams (Bad dreams)
Baby, please
Ooh, ooh, ooh
All of these (Baby, please)
All of these
