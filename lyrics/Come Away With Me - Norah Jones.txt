Come away with me in the night
Come away with me
And I will write you a song

Come away with me on a bus

Come away with me, and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me
And I'll never stop lovin' you


And I wanna wake up with the rain
Fallin' on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night
Come away with me
