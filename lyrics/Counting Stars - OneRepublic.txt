Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars"

I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashin' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doin' what we're told

I feel somethin' so right doin' the wrong thing
And I feel somethin' so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars", yeah

I feel your love, and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
"Hope" is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doin' what we're told

And I feel somethin' so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars"

Oh, take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars"

Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
