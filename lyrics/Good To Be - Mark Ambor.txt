6 ContributorsGood To Be Lyrics
Maybe I'm not some chosen one
But, damnit, I'm my father's son
And that's something I'm pretty proud to be
The colder days have drawn their guns
The warmer days are on the run
And I hate that I'm stuck right in between

I'll turn my gray skies blue
Just tryna be like you

Going top down in that old Mercedes
Music loud, go ahead and hate me
Spare the nickel, I'll just keep the dime
Find ways to cut the fat
Hot coffee and a Trident pack
Damnit, it's so good to be alive

Heroes come to save a mess
You sewed the holes inside my chest
And found a way to soak up all the stains
Got all my anger bottled up
A drop away to fill that cup
But, any more and I might go insane

Oh, I'll turn my gray skies blue
Just tryna be like you

(Ooh) Going top down in that old Mercedes
Music loud, go ahead and hate me
Spare the nickel, I'll just keep the dime
Find ways to cut the fat
Hot coffee and a Trident pack
Damnit, it's so good to be alive


Damnit, it's so good to be alive
(Hey!)
