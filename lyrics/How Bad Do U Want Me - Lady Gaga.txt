The good girl in your dreams
Is mad you're lovin' me
I know you wish that she was me
How bad, bad do you want me?
You're not the guy that cheats (The guy that cheats)
And you're afraid that she might leave (That she might leave)
'Cause if I get too close, she might scream
"How bad, bad do you want me?"

'Cause you like my hair, my ripped-up jeans
You like the bad girl I got in me
She's on your mind, like, all the time
But I got a tattoo for us last week
Even good boys bleed
How bad, bad do you want me? (How bad, bad do you want me?)
(How bad, bad do you want me?)
'Cause you hate thе crash, but you love the rush
And I'll make your hеart weak every time
You hear my name, 'cause she's in your brain
And I'm here to kiss you in real life
'Bout to cause a scene
How bad, bad do you want me?

You panic in your sleep (Panic in your sleep)
And you feel like such a creep (Feel like such a creep)
'Cause with your eyes closed, you might peek
So hot, hot that you can't speak
You're so fucked up with your crew (Fucked up with your crew)
But when you're all alone, it's true (All alone, it's true)
You know exactly what we'd do
How bad, bad do you want to?

'Cause you like my hair, my ripped-up jeans
You like the bad girl I got in me
She's on your mind, like, all the time
But I got a tattoo for us last week
Even good boys bleed
How bad, bad do you want me? (How bad, bad do you want me?)
(How bad, bad do you want me?)
'Cause you hate the crash, but you love the rush
And I'll make your heart weak every time
You hear my name, 'cause she's in your brain
And I'm here to kiss you in real life
'Bout to cause a scene
How bad, bad do you want me?

Uh-oh, oh, you love a good girl
Uh-oh, oh, you love a good girl bad
Uh-oh, oh, you make a bad girl
Uh-oh, oh, you make a bad girl mad
A psychotic love theme
How bad do you want me?

That girl in your head ain't real
How bad do you want me, for real? (Oh)

'Cause you like my hair, my ripped-up jeans
You like the bad girl I got in me
She's on your mind, like, all the time
But I got a tattoo for us last week
Even good boys bleed
How bad, bad do you want me? (How bad, bad do you want me?)
(How bad? Tell me)
'Cause you hate the crash, but you love the rush
And I'll make your heart weak every time
You hear my name, but she's in your brain
And I'm here to kiss you in real life
'Bout to cause a scene
How bad, bad do you want me?

Uh-oh, oh, you love a good girl
Uh-oh, oh, you love a good girl bad
Uh-oh, oh, you make a bad girl
Uh-oh, oh, you make a bad girl mad
A psychotic love theme
How bad do you want me?
