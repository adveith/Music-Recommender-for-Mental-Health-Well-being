Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no
Yeah, yeah, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Yeah, you're my sunshine
You're the only one I wanna give all my time
There's just somethin' about it
Soon as we met, I couldn't even help it
Yeah, I got a feelin', and I can't ignore it

I ain't playin' no games, I mean what I say
Got you on my mind, if you feel the same
Won't you swing my way? Baby, don't make me wait
I don't know if it's meant to be, but it feels like everything

Is this love? (Is this love?) Is this love?
Is this love? (Is this love?) Is this love?
Takin' over me feel that energy
Is this love? Is this love?

I don't know why they say love is so blind
Somethin' so hard to find, but I think we found it
I think we got it, no doubt about it
If it ain't then what's love? (What's love?)
Someone, tell me what's up (*What's up?*)

What's love gonna do when you feelin' blue?
You been lookin' for the truth, so I'm tellin' you
But all this time in the back of my mind
It's back to remind me, so let me learn what I never knew
Now you got me like, "Ooh, I don't care, I want you to take me there"
Baby, let's get away, will I know what it means one day?

Is this love? (Is this love?) Is this love? (Is this love?)
Is this love? (Is this love?) Is this love? (Is this love?)
Takin' over me (Over), feel that energy (That energy)
Is this love? (Is this love?) Is this love? (Ooh)

Some things I just can't seem to figure out
This feelin' of love jumpin' up and down
Still don't get it, just bein' honest
Guess I'm stuck here with the same question, baby

Is this love? (Love) Is this love?
Is this love? (Tell me, is this love?) Is this love? (Is it really love?)
Takin' *over me* (Ooh), *feel that energy* (That energy)
*Is this love? Is this love?*

So, tell me, is this love?
