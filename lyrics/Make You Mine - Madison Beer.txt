I, I, I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste, wanna get you goin'
I, I, I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string, wanna make you mine

Step inside my mind, you can see the shrine
Got you on my walls, believe it (Believe it)
Baby, don't be scared, want you everywhere
Catch you if you fall, I mean it (I mean it)

Closer I get
Can you resist?
It's relentless
It's why

I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush, I wanna get you goin'
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you out, I wanna make you mine
I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush, I wanna feel
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you out, I wanna make you mine

I, I, I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste, wanna get you goin'
I, I, I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string, wanna make you mine
Make you mine

(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
Make you mine

See it in my eyes, how they never lie
Just a little bite, are you dreamin'? (Are you dreamin'?)
Now I got you up, would you look at us?
Fantasy to life, and I'm screamin', screamin'

Closer I get
Can you resist?
It's relentless
It's why

I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush, I wanna get you goin'
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you out, I wanna make you mine
I wanna feel the rush
I wanna taste the crush, I wanna feel
I wanna lay you down
I wanna string you out, I wanna make you mine

I, I, I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste, wanna get you goin'
I, I, I wanna lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string, wanna make you mine
I, I, I wanna feel, feel, feel
Wanna taste, taste, taste, wanna get you goin'
I, I, I, lay, lay, lay
Wanna string, string, string, wanna make you mine
Make you mine

(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
(Can't you feel the rush?)
Make you mine
