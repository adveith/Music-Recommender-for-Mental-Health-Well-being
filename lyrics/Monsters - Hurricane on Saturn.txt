If someone of Betternoise bandwagon has got balls
I wanna see how large I’ll wait him on the ring to see
Who is undisputedly in command

We are the monsters
We never let you down
We are the monsters
We rule this fucking town
We are the monsters
From your baddest dreams
We are the monsters
The everyone's enemies
I’m the dust devils army general in charge
All my faithful soldiers hold me in high regard
I’ve earned respect on the frontline of the battlefield
My boys trust and follow me in their fucking free will
I got the skills to do what I do, understood?
In every place I go I got a handful of my goons
No matter how hard you try to forget our mask
We are the monsters of your nightmares
Dakm here we go again

We spy you while you sleep we crawl into your mind
We sneak out from your closet sometimes
You better change your way or you’ll live in fear
The vengeance of the outcasts is getting near
The world is going mad but no one's saying a shit
The music scene goes in reverse and no one talk about it uh
Isn’t it motherfuckers? bleah…

Deuce
Ok we fuckin drunk
We taken shots n tossin dollas like we donald trump
Ninelives in the buildin ain't no stoppin us
Ninelives in the buildin ya you know wussup
We can fucked up
We make the club bump
We make the club jump
We leave these motha fuckin rappers in the fuckin slump
My page be blowin up
Thes girls be goin nuts
I know it's hard to stunt
I made it hard to front
Ninelives bitch thats ninelives
You know we turn it up
Yes it’s ninelives bitch
We gunna turn it up
You know we turn it up


Maydx wants to say you something more
Is the party over yet?
Everytime I think about the ways
They figure out to sell the shit
That’s coming out from their mouth
It’s complicated not to laugh
But I don’t wanna shoot the face
Of motherfuckin mangy dogs
Bitch eeny meeny miny moe
I see the mummies fucking yo
You swallow easier than a hoe
I tell you what
If you let me come into your room
I’m gonna crash your fuckin doom
You faggots standing in fuckin line
To drink piss and say it's ol’ good wine
Boo
