2 ContributorsPRETTY WHEN I CRY Lyrics
I'm pretty when I cry
I’m pretty when I cry

Be careful what you wish for
Or you'll end up just like me
I got nothing left to live for
And a soul that only bleeds

I cross my heart and hope to die
Swear, I'd choose you in every life
Cross my heart and hope to die

At least I’m pretty when I cry
If you don't kill me, then bury me alive
Love is torture and you're counting crimes
Open casket, so you can see why
I'm pretty when I cry
All my tears fall like rain in the night
At the graveyard of all your goodbyеs
If you kiss me, I'll come back to life
I'm prеtty when I cry

Let me worship all the bad things you do
'Cause I'll break down once I see the hard truth
And the worst pain is I’m still hung up on you
’Cause I know I'd do it all over again

Cross my heart and hope to die
Swear, you could have saved my life
I cross my heart and hope to die

At least I’m pretty when I cry (Pretty when I cry)
If you don't kill me, then bury me alive (Bury me alive)
Love is torture and you're counting crimes
Open casket, so you can see why (You can see why)
I'm pretty when I cry (Pretty when I cry)
All my tears fall like rain in the night (In the night)
At the graveyard of all your goodbyes
If you kiss me, I’ll come back to life (Come back to life)

I'm pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry
Pretty when I cry
Mm
