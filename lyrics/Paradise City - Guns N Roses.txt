Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)


Just a' urchin livin' under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Rags to riches, or so they say, you gotta
Keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's- it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' the time
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah, yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The Surgeon General says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette, but I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah, yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah


So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

Captain America's been torn apart, now
He's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start"
I must be losin' my mind, "Are you blind?"
I've seen it all a million times

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah, yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah, yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Home

(Oh) I wanna go, I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see how good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home)
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down (Oh, yeah), meet me 'round
Oh, won't you please take me home? (Home)
I wanna see (Oh, yeah), how good it can be (Oh, yeah)
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see, ooh, how good it can be
Oh, oh, take me home
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? (Oh, won't you, oh, won't you take me home)
I wanna know (I wanna know), I wanna know (I wanna know)

Oh, won't you please take me home?
Yeah, baby
Please
