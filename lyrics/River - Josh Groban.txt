3 ContributorsRiver Lyrics
Some days I can't say why I'm feeling lonely
Some days I am too proud to ask for help
And I stumble through the noise
Trying to find some peace
A stranger in the crowd, I lose myself

So, I walk down to the river
Where the troubles, they can't find me
Let the waters there remind me
The sun will be there when we wake
I walk down to the river
Though I might not understand it
It's not always as we planned it
But we grow stronger when we break
So, I walk down to the river
I walk down to the river

This raging world can get so overwhelming
Looking for a meaning when it won't make sense
In my head its getting loud
Like i can't outrun this cloud
No matter where i go well there i am

So, I walk down to the river
Where the troubles, they can't find me
Let the waters there remind me
The sun will be there when we wake
I walk down to the river
Though I might not understand it
It's not always as we planned it
But we grow stronger when we break
So, I walk down to the river
I walk down to the river

Let the calm pull me under
Far beyond the thunder
Tell me it will all be ok
Let the waves take all my worries
Conquer them with fury
Give me shelter be my escape

I walk down to the river
Where the troubles, they can't find me
Let the waters there remind me
The sun will be there when we wake

I walk down to the river
Though I might not understand it
It's not always as we planned it
But we grow stronger when we break
So, I walk down to the river
I walk down to the river (x4)
To the river (x2)
I walk down oh, oh, oh
To the river oh, oh, oh
