I saw her in the rightest way
Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen and coughed, and coughed
And then she came up to my knees
Begging, "Baby, would you please
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me?"

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in His favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long

She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever worked out, worked out
And maybe I tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long

And we can run away to the walls inside your house
I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about
We can go forever or until you wanna sit it out
