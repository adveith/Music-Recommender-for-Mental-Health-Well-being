Would you know my name
If I saw you in Heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in Heaven?

I must be strong
And carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong

Would you hold my hand

Would you help me stand
If I saw you in Heaven?

Through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay

Time can break your heart
Have you begging please
Begging please


Beyond the door
There's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in Heaven

Would you know my name
If I saw you in Heaven?
Would you be the same
If I saw you in Heaven?

I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in Heaven
