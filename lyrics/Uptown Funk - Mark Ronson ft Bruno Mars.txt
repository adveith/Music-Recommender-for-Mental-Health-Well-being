This hit, the ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one, for them hood girls

Fill my cup put some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign the check

Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon’ show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy

I'm too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and the fireman

Say my name you know who I am
