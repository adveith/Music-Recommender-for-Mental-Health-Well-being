Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older

I just wanna use your love tonight
And I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover

I just wanna use your love tonight, oh
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shakin'
'Cause somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we were all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'

As you’re leaving, please, would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told ya:
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon

I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah
I don't wanna lose your love tonight, yeah
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight
(Lose your love)
(Lose your love)

Tonight (Lose your love)
No, I don't wanna lose (Lose your love tonight)
I don't wanna, no, I don't wanna
I don't wanna (Lose your love tonight)
No, no (Lose your love tonight)
(Lose your love tonight)
(No) No (I don't wanna lose your love tonight)
(Lose your love tonight)
