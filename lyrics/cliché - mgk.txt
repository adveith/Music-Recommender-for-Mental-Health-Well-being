19 Contributorscliché Lyrics
Tell me, would you wait for me?
Baby, I'm a rolling stone
I got a lotta right in me
But I don't wanna say this wrong
Tell me, would you stay with me?
Maybe we could make this home
You should run away with me
Even if you're better off alone

I like that you like me
I kissed your lips, you got good taste
I like that you like me
I could close my eyes and draw your face
If you take this chance
I'll give you oxygen to breathe me in
But I'll say sorry in advance, mm-mm

My head's a mess
It's like that every day and
I'll try my best
It sounds cliché, but

Tell me, would you wait for me?
Baby, I'm a rolling stone
I got a lotta right in me
But I don't wanna say this wrong
Tell me, would you stay with me?
Maybe we could make this home
You should run away with me
Even if you're better off alone (Uh)

Your name is in neon light in the sky when darkness surrounds us
Let's leave this town, get married, go to Vegas and create nostalgia
Tell me, will you save this dance?
I feel my knees get weak beneath me
I know this night might be our last, mm-mm

My head's a mess
It's like that every day and
I'll try my best
It sounds cliché, but

Tell me, would you wait for me?
Baby, I'm a rolling stone
I got a lotta right in me
But I don't wanna say this wrong
Tell me, would you stay with me?
Maybe we could make this home
You should run away with me
Even if you're better off alone

Tell me, would you wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for me?
Tell me, would you wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for me?

Tell me, would you wait for me?
Mm-mm
Baby, I'm a rolling stone
Mm-mm
I got a lotta right in me
Mm-mm
But I don't wanna say this wrong
I don't wanna say this wrong (Yeah)

Tell me, would you wait for me?
Baby, I'm a rolling stone
I got a lotta right in me
But I don't wanna say this wrong (Say this wrong)
Tell me, would you stay with me?
Maybe we could make this home (Make this home)
You should run away with me
Even if you're better off alone

Tell me, would you wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for me?
Tell me, would you wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for me?
Wait for me
