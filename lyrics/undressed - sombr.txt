You had a dream, you wanted better
You were sick of all the holes in your sweater
You looked to me and wondered whether
I was the lamppost to which you were tethered

I'm lookin' at you, and you're lookin' at me
But the glimmer in your eyes is sayin' you wanna leave
You're sayin' to me what you're sayin' to me
But the glimmer in your eyes is telling me other things

I don't wanna get undrеssed
For a new person all ovеr again
I don't wanna kiss someone else's neck
And have to pretend it's yours instead


I took the train to see my mother
I look across the tracks to see you with another
There's nothin' worse than seein' your lover
Moving on while you still suffer

I'm lookin' at you, and you're lookin' at me
But the glimmer in your eyes is sayin' you wanna leave
You're sayin' to me what you're sayin' to me
But the glimmer in your eyes is telling me other things

I don't wanna get undressed
For a new person all over again
I don't wanna kiss someone else's neck
And have to pretend it's yours instead

And I don't wanna learn another scent
I don't want the children of another man
To have the eyes of the girl I won't forget
I won't forget

I don't wanna get undressed
For a new person all over again
I don't wanna kiss someone else's neck
And have to pretend it's yours instead

I don't wanna get undressed
For a new person all over again
