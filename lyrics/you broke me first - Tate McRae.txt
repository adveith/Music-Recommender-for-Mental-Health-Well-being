You broke me first, ah

Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple months, so you're callin' me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I coulda ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first (You broke me first)
You broke me first, ah
